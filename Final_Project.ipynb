        "\n",
        "The purpose of this script is to enrich the MovieLens movie dataset (`movies.dat`) with detailed movie metadata from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This metadata includes movie overviews, genres, poster and backdrop image URLs, cast and director information, keywords, user ratings, and trailer links. The enriched dataset will serve as the foundation for building content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommender systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Methodology**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Load MovieLens Movie Data**\n",
        "   The script loads the `movies.dat` file, which contains basic movie information including `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Clean Titles and Extract Years**\n",
        "   It processes the movie titles to remove the year from the title string and separately extracts the release year to improve search accuracy when querying TMDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Query TMDB API**\n",
        "   For each movie, it sends a search request to TMDB using the cleaned title and release year. If a match is found, it retrieves the movie’s TMDB ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Retrieve Detailed Metadata**\n",
        "   Using the TMDB ID, the script fetches:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Overview (plot summary)\n",
        "   * Poster and backdrop image paths\n",
        "   * Genre IDs, which are then mapped to readable genre names\n",
        "   * Top 3 cast members\n",
        "   * Director(s)\n",
        "   * Associated keywords\n",
        "   * YouTube trailer link (if available)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Construct and Save Enriched Dataset**\n",
        "   All metadata is compiled into a structured format and merged with the original MovieLens data. The final dataset is saved as `movies_enriched_full.csv` for downstream use in recommendation models.\n"

        "***Purpose:***\n",
        "\n",
        "This module implements **memory-based collaborative filtering** using **user-user** or **item-item** similarity. It addresses **user bias** by normalizing ratings through mean-centering and optionally **rescaling predictions** to the original rating scale for interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Methodology:***\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Rating Matrix Construction**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * A user-item matrix is built from raw MovieLens-style ratings data.\n",
        "   * For `kind='user'`, ratings are mean-centered per user to reduce bias from lenient or strict raters.\n",
        "   * For `kind='item'`, raw ratings are used directly (no normalization), as the algorithm focuses on item similarities based on a single user's input.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Similarity Computation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Cosine similarity is computed either:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * **Across users** for user-based CF (`kind='user'`)\n",
        "     * **Across items** for item-based CF (`kind='item'`)\n",
        "   * `sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances` is used to derive similarity as `1 - cosine_distance`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Prediction Generation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * For **user-based CF**:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Ratings from similar users are weighted by similarity and averaged.\n",
        "     * The user’s mean rating is **added back** to restore predictions to the original scale (e.g., 1–5).\n",
        "   * For **item-based CF**:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * A user’s own ratings are used to compute scores for similar items.\n",
        "     * No mean is added back, since predictions are already on the correct scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Top-N Recommendations**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The system filters out movies the user has already rated.\n",
        "   * It ranks unseen movies by predicted score and returns the top-N recommendations.\n",
        "   * Each recommendation is labeled with the model type (`User-Based CF` or `Item-Based CF`) for downstream tracking."

        "5. **Store and Rank Results:**\n",

        "6. **Visualize Results:**\n",
