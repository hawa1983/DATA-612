        "\n",
        "* Normalizing the genre vectors using **L2 norm** so that each vector has unit length.\n",
        "* Calculating **cosine similarity** between movie vectors to measure how similar their genre compositions are.\n",

        "# Hybrid Content-Based Rating Prediction Using Genre Similarity, User Behavior, and Fallback Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "This code demonstrates a *hybrid recommendation system* that combines **content-based filtering using genre similarity** with **collaborative filtering using user-specific ratings**. The objective is to predict how much a user will like a movie they've never seen, based on the genres of that movie and their past rating behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The prediction process incorporates a **fallback mechanism** and **debug printouts** to gracefully handle edge cases where standard hybrid predictions arenâ€™t possible. These cases include users with no rating history, movies not present in the similarity matrix, or when no meaningful similarity is found.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Genre Vector Normalization**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The genre columns are multi-hot encoded (e.g., Action, Comedy, etc.).\n",
        "   * Each movieâ€™s genre vector is normalized using L2 norm so that cosine similarity is well-defined and scale-invariant.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Genre-Based Similarity Matrix**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Cosine similarity is computed between all pairs of movies based on genre vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mapping Setup**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The code builds lookup maps between `movieId` and its corresponding row index in the genre matrix to allow fast access.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hybrid Prediction Function**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * For a given `user_id` and `movie_id`, the function:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Retrieves all movies rated by the user.\n",
        "     * Finds the top-K rated movies that are most genre-similar to the target movie.\n",
        "     * Computes a **weighted average of the ratings**, where the weights are the genre similarity scores.\n",
        "     * **If no such ratings or similarities are available**, the function **falls back to the global average rating of the movie**.\n",
        "     * Each fallback trigger is logged with a `[Debug]` message.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Application**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * The model is tested on a sample user and generates predicted ratings for movies that are most similar in genre to a reference movie (e.g., *Heat (1995)*).\n",
        "\n",
        "This hybrid approach offers:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Personalization from collaborative filtering.\n",
        "* Interpretability from content-based features (genres).\n",
        "* Robustness from fallback logic to handle cold-starts or sparse data situations.\n"

        "\n",
        "**1. Data Preparation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* It loads the `ratings` and `movies` datasets.\n",
        "* The user-movie ratings matrix is built using `.pivot()` (rows = users, columns = movies, values = ratings).\n",
        "* Movie genres are split and one-hot encoded using `MultiLabelBinarizer`.\n",
        "* Genre vectors are normalized to enable cosine similarity comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Genre Similarity Calculation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cosine similarity is computed between normalized genre vectors of all movies.\n",

        "This is the main prediction function. Here's what it does:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Step 1**: Skips invalid user/movie inputs.\n",
        "* **Step 2**: Loops through all other users (excluding the target user).\n",
        "* **Step 3**: For each user, checks if they rated the target movie.\n",
        "* **Step 4**: Collects that user's other rated movies and looks up genre similarity between those and the target movie.\n",
        "* **Step 5**: Uses a weighted average of the other user's ratings on similar movies, weighted by genre similarity.\n",
        "* **Step 6**: Averages all such weighted predictions from other users to generate the final prediction.\n",
        "* **Fallback**: If no useful ratings are found, it falls back to the global average rating for the movie.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Prediction Execution**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The code sets `user_id = 174949` and `target_movie = 'O.J.: Made in America (2016)'`.\n",
        "* It retrieves the `movieId` and runs the `hybrid_predict()` function.\n",
        "* Finally, it prints the predicted rating for that user and movie.\n",
        "\n",
        "*This approach combines user behavior (collaborative filtering) with genre-based content similarity to improve prediction accuracy, especially for sparse data or cold-start problems.*\n"

Unlike the traditional nested-loop approach, this implementation uses the `pdist()` function from `scipy.spatial.distance` to compute all pairwise Jaccard distances in a **fully vectorized** manner. The result is a symmetric similarity matrix, which is then used to identify the most similar movies to a given title. This optimization drastically reduces computation time and is highly recommended for medium-to-large datasets.\n",

The method is designed to make personalized movie rating predictions even in cases of sparse data.\n",

        "**1. Data Sampling and Matrix Construction**\n",
        "A sample of 10,000 users is drawn randomly from the full ratings dataset to manage memory and computational requirements. A user-movie matrix is constructed using these ratings, where each cell represents the rating a user has given to a movie. The system computes average ratings per user (user bias) and per movie (item bias) to help model baseline tendencies.\n",

        "# User-Based Collaborative Filtering with Cosine Similarity and Bias Adjustment\n",
        "\n",
        "This system predicts how a user might rate a movie they havenâ€™t seen, using the behavior of similar users. It employs a user-based collaborative filtering approach, enhanced with cosine similarity and bias adjustment, and includes fallback logic to handle missing data. Below is a breakdown of the methodology with the purpose of each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Data Preparation**\n",
        "*Purpose: To structure the raw data into a usable format for similarity computation and rating prediction.*\n",
        "\n",
        "* Loads the movie metadata and user ratings datasets.\n",
        "* Constructs a user-movie matrix, where rows represent users and columns represent movies.\n",
        "* Calculates:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Each userâ€™s average rating (to normalize personal biases)\n",
        "  * Each movieâ€™s average rating (used in fallback logic)\n",
        "  * The global average rating (used as a last-resort fallback)\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Similarity Matrix Handling**\n",
        "*Purpose: To determine how similar each user is to every other user, based on shared rating behavior.*\n",
        "This step ensures that a valid user-user cosine similarity matrix is available by following one of three approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Check for a Local File:**\n",
        "  If the matrix already exists on the local machine, it is loaded directly for efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Download from Cloud Storage:**\n",
        "  If the local file is missing, the system attempts to download a precomputed matrix from Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Compute Similarity Manually:**\n",
        "  If downloading fails:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * User ratings are centered by subtracting their individual means\n",
        "  * Missing ratings are filled with zeros to allow matrix operations\n",
        "  * Cosine similarity is computed between users\n",
        "  * The resulting matrix is saved locally for future reuse\n",
        "\n",
        "This three-step fallback ensures the system is flexible and always functional, regardless of file availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Rating Prediction with Bias Adjustment**\n",
        "*Purpose: To predict how a specific user would rate a specific movie using insights from similar users.*\n",
        "\n",
        "* Identifies users who have rated the target movie.\n",
        "* Measures similarity between the target user and those users using cosine similarity.\n",
        "* Selects the top *k* most similar users (neighbors).\n",
        "* Calculates how much each neighborâ€™s rating deviates from their average and weighs it by their similarity score.\n",
        "* Adjusts the target userâ€™s mean rating by the weighted deviation to produce a prediction.\n",
        "* Applies fallback rules using movie mean or global mean if not enough neighbors are found or similarity is too low.\n",
        "* Prediction is capped between 0.5 and 5.0 to stay within valid rating bounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Random Test Pair Selection**\n",
        "*Purpose: To automatically select a valid (user, movie) pair for prediction testing.*\n",
        "\n",
        "* Randomly picks a user who has not rated a given movie.\n",
        "* Ensures that at least *k* other users have rated the movie to allow meaningful prediction.\n",
        "* Returns a user-movie pair for evaluation of the recommender system.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Prediction Test and Fallback Demonstration**\n",
        "*Purpose: To test and demonstrate the prediction capability and the fallback mechanism.*\n",
        "\n",
        "* Predicts a rating for the selected user-movie pair using the cosine similarity method.\n",
        "* Also tests a fallback scenario where a user has not rated the movie and may lack sufficient neighbor data.\n",
        "* This helps verify that the system can return predictions even when data is sparse.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "Each step in this system is designed to make the recommender engine both accurate and resilient. The approach prioritizes reusability and speed (by checking local files first), enhances prediction quality through bias correction, and ensures coverage with intelligent fallback strategies. The result is a scalable and dependable collaborative filtering system for personalized movie recommendations.\n"

        "# Item-Item Collaborative Filtering Using Jaccard Similarity with Bias-Based Fallback\n",
        "\n",
        "This methodology implements a recommender system based on **item-item collaborative filtering**. It leverages **Jaccard similarity** between items and incorporates a **bias-adjusted fallback mechanism** to produce robust rating predictions in sparse or cold-start scenarios. The approach focuses on whether users have interacted with items rather than how they rated them, making it suitable when explicit feedback is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Data Preparation and Sampling**\n",
        "\n",
        "To reduce memory and computational overhead, a random sample of 10,000 users is extracted from the original ratings dataset. The system then constructs a **user-movie rating matrix**, where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and values represent ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "From this matrix, the following statistics are calculated:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **User means** â€“ average rating per user\n",
        "* **Item means** â€“ average rating per item\n",
        "* **Global mean** â€“ overall average rating in the dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "These statistics serve as fallback predictors when sufficient similarity-based signals are not available.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Binary Matrix and Jaccard Similarity**\n",
        "\n",
        "A binary matrix is generated where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A value of 1 indicates that a user rated a movie.\n",
        "* A value of 0 indicates no rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "This binary matrix is transposed to form a **movie-user matrix**, which is used to compute **Jaccard similarity** between all pairs of movies:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{Jaccard}(A, B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* $A$ and $B$ are sets of users who rated movies A and B, respectively.\n",
        "* The intersection represents the number of users who rated both.\n",
        "* The union represents users who rated either.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The similarity matrix is cached to a local file.\n",
        "* If the file exists or is downloadable from Google Drive, it's reused to avoid recomputation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Item-Item Rating Prediction with Bias Adjustment**\n",
        "\n",
        "To predict a userâ€™s rating for a movie using **item-item collaborative filtering**, the algorithm follows these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Retrieve all movies the user has rated.\n",
        "2. Compute similarity scores between the target movie and these rated movies.\n",
        "3. Select the top-k most similar movies.\n",
        "4. Take a **similarity-weighted average** of the user's ratings for those movies:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\hat{r}_{u,i} = \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} \\text{sim}(i,j) \\cdot r_{u,j}}{\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} \\text{sim}(i,j)}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "If the denominator (sum of similarities) is zero, indicating no informative neighbors, the system falls back to a **bias-adjusted estimate**:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\hat{r}_{u,i} = \\mu_u + \\mu_i - \\mu_{\\text{global}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This combines the userâ€™s average rating ($\\mu_u$) and the itemâ€™s average rating ($\\mu_i$), offset by the global average to reduce bias accumulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "All predictions are **clamped** to the valid rating range $0.5, 5.0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Cold-Start and Fallback Simulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "A fallback test is included to simulate **cold-start scenarios**, where a user has not rated the target movie. In such cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A random user who hasnâ€™t rated the movie is selected.\n",
        "* The prediction function is run with fallback logic engaged.\n",
        "* This ensures the system remains functional even in sparse user-item interaction environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "This hybrid item-item collaborative filtering system blends **Jaccard-based similarity** with **statistical bias correction**, ensuring:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Interpretability from co-engagement patterns.\n",
        "* Resilience to sparse data.\n",
        "* Compatibility with binary interaction datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is well-suited for systems where usersâ€™ presence or absence (rather than rating intensity) carries the signal of interest â€” such as click, view, or purchase histories.\n"

        "# Item-Item Collaborative Filtering Using Cosine Similarity with Bias-Aware Fallback\n",
        "\n",
        "This recommender system employs item-item collaborative filtering powered by cosine similarity and enhanced with bias-aware fallback logic. It is designed to deliver personalized movie rating predictions while ensuring robustness in cases of sparse data or cold-start users.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Data Preparation and Sampling**\n",
        "A random sample of 10,000 users is selected from the ratings dataset to reduce computational load. A user-movie matrix is then constructed with user IDs as rows, movie IDs as columns, and rating values as the matrix entries.\n",
        "From this matrix, the following statistics are computed:\n",
        "\n",
        "* User mean: the average rating each user gives\n",
        "* Item mean: the average rating each movie receives\n",
        "* Global mean: the overall average rating across all users and movies\n",
        "\n",
        "These serve as the baseline for fallback predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Cosine Similarity Matrix Construction**\n",
        "The user-movie matrix is transposed to obtain a movie-user matrix. Missing values are filled with zeros so that cosine similarity can be calculated between every pair of movies. Cosine similarity measures how similar two movies are based on users who rated them both, using the formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "cosine(A, B) = (A â‹… B) / (||A|| Ã— ||B||)\n",
        "\n",
        "Where A and B are rating vectors for two movies.\n",
        "To avoid recomputation, the similarity matrix is saved locally or loaded from a Google Drive file when available.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Predicting Ratings Using Top-k Similar Movies**\n",
        "To estimate how a user would rate a movie they havenâ€™t seen, the system:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Identifies the set of movies the user has already rated\n",
        "* Retrieves cosine similarities between the target movie and those rated movies\n",
        "* Selects the top-k most similar movies\n",
        "* Calculates a weighted average of the userâ€™s ratings for those top-k movies using their similarity scores as weights\n",
        "\n",
        "The predicted rating is computed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "rÌ‚(u,i) = âˆ‘ sim(i,j) Ã— r(u,j) / âˆ‘ sim(i,j)\n",
        "\n",
        "If the similarity weights sum to zero, the system triggers the fallback mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Bias-Based Fallback Strategy**\n",
        "When there are no similar movies rated by the user, or if similarity weights are zero, a bias-aware fallback formula is used:\n",
        "\n",
        "rÌ‚(u,i) = Î¼\\_u + Î¼\\_i âˆ’ Î¼\\_global\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Î¼\\_u is the userâ€™s average rating\n",
        "* Î¼\\_i is the movieâ€™s average rating\n",
        "* Î¼\\_global is the global average rating\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures that even without similarity-based support, the model can make meaningful predictions. All predictions are clamped to the valid range \\[0.5, 5.0].\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Cold-Start Testing and Prediction Validation**\n",
        "The system includes functionality to identify suitable user-movie pairs for prediction testing, as well as simulate cold-start conditions by selecting users who havenâ€™t rated a specific movie. This allows for evaluation of the fallback mechanism under realistic sparse data scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "This item-item collaborative filtering approach with cosine similarity provides an interpretable and resilient recommendation system. By incorporating user, item, and global bias in its fallback logic, the model remains functional and reliable even in the absence of strong similarity signals.\n"
